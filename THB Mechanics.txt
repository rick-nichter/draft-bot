THB notes:
- Draft a deck where all cards contribute to the same plan
- Build/draft with maximizing best cards in mind (top 20 cards WAY better than other 234)

- Green-White (GW) Auras

How I'm representing archetypes:
	Each card gets a rating from 0.0-5.0 for each archetype. Rough details based on rating:
	0.0: Cannot be played in archetype (incorrect colors)
	0.5: Possible to play, but is so bad that it should not be
	1.0: Probably shouldn't be played except in rare cases
	2.0: Could be played, but there are likely better options
	3.0: Ought to be played; it fits well with the theme
	4.0: One of the best cards of this theme
	5.0: The best card for this archetype
