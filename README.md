# draft-bot

This project attempts to create an agent that can intelligently participate in a Magic: The Gathering (MTG) draft. It utilizes a drafting simulator from Cardsphere (https://draft.cardsphere.com/) to retrieve data for and simulate each draft. Currently, only the set Theros Beyond Death is in scope for this agent.
